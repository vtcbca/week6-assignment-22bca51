3. Dump table into csv file "result.csv".

with open('c:\\sqlite3\\result.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(['Student ID', 'Student Name', 'Subject 1',
'Subject 2', 'Subject 3', 'Subject 4', 'Subject 5', 'Total Marks',
'Grade'])
    writer.writerows(result_table)


4. Read result.csv file and Print Total Marks and Grade of each student. Also Append Total Marks and Grade column into result.csv file.

with open('c:\\sqlite3\\result.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    next(reader)  # Skip header row
    for row in reader:
        student_id, student_name, *subject_marks, total_marks, grade = row
        print(f"Student ID: {student_id}, Student Name:
{student_name}, Total Marks: {total_marks}, Grade: {grade}")

OUTPUT :
	Student ID: 1, Student Name:Zaid, Total Marks: 340, Grade: First
	Student ID: 2, Student Name:Roshan, Total Marks: 399, Grade: First
	Student ID: 3, Student Name:Jenil, Total Marks: 409, Grade: Distinction

	Student ID: 9, Student Name:Kajal, Total Marks: 419, Grade: Distinction
	Student ID: 10, Student Name:Hiren, Total Marks: 318, Grade: Fail


5. List out Top 3 Student id and name with its percentage.

sorted_results = sorted(result_table, key=lambda x: x[-2],
reverse=True)  # Sort by total marks
print("\nTop 3 Students:")
for i in range(3):
    student_id, student_name, *_, total_marks, grade = sorted_results[i]
    percentage = (int(total_marks) / 500) * 100
    print(f"Student ID: {student_id}, Student Name: {student_name},
Percentage: {percentage}%")
OUTPUT :
	Top 3 Students:
	Student ID: 6, Student Name: Nikunj,Percentage: 85.39999999999999%
	Student ID: 9, Student Name: Kajal,Percentage: 83.8%
	Student ID: 3, Student Name: Jenil,Percentage: 81.8%
